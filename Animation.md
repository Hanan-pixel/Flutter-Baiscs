## Components of the Animation
- **AnimationController:** Manages the animation's state, including the duration and progress.
- **CurvedAnimation:** Adds a curve (in this case, Curves.elasticOut) to the animation, giving it a smooth and more natural feel.
- **ScaleTransition:** Uses the animation to scale the size of the checkmark.

### Initialization
```ruby
late AnimationController _controller;
late Animation<double> _animation;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _controller = AnimationController(
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
    vsync: this,
  );

  _animation = CurvedAnimation(
    parent: _controller,
    curve: Curves.elasticOut,
  );

  _controller.forward();
}

```

### AnimationController:
The AnimationController is initialized with a duration of 1 second.
vsync is provided by SingleTickerProviderStateMixin, which helps the animation to be efficient by using a single ticker for the animation.
### CurvedAnimation:
A CurvedAnimation is created to apply the Curves.elasticOut curve to the animation, which makes the checkmark scale in with a slight bounce effect.
### _controller.forward():

This method starts the animation as soon as the widget is initialized.
